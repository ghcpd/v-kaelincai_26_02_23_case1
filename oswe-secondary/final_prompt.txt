Hey, I've got a Python XML document parser project that's currently failing some security tests - when processing certain specially crafted XML files, the parser is exposing sensitive file contents that it absolutely shouldn't be able to access, and this is causing 4 out of 7 tests to fail while the basic functionality tests pass fine. I need you to identify what's making the parser insecure, fix it so that all tests pass (especially those security-focused ones), and put the corrected version in a new directory called issue_project_fixed while keeping the original untouched. After you make the changes, please run the test script to confirm that all 7 tests now pass and that normal XML parsing still works correctly but the malicious XML files can no longer leak sensitive data.
